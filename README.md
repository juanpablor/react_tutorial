## How it works

### Install dependencies and launch the app:

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

### IF Errors on `npm install`
Attempt Running `npm install` as sudo.

### IF Errors on `npm start`
`Error: Cannot find module 'connect-route'` Error resolves by running `npm install connect-route`
